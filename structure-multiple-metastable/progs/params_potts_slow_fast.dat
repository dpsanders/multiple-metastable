# Parameters for Potts model with 2->1-->0,
# i.e. 2 decays slowly to 1, which decays fast to 0
# Starting from 2, there is thus no visible fast timescale

# Number of spin types q:
3

# List of values of fields of each type: first column is type, second is value
2	0.0
1	0.2
0	0.8

# List of interactions other than Potts type. (Can override Potts ones too.)
# First two columns give the spin types of the interaction; the third column is the new value

2 1		-0.3
1 0		-0.3
2 0		-2
