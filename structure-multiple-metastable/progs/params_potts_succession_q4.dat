# Parameters for Potts model with 3--->2-->1->0,
# i.e. 3 decays to 2 fast, then 2 to 1 and 1 to 0

# Number of spin types q:
4

# List of values of fields of each type: first column is type, second is value
3  0.0
2	0.8
1	1.2
0	1.4

# List of interactions other than Potts type. (Can override Potts ones too.)
# First two columns give the spin types of the interaction; the third column is the new value
