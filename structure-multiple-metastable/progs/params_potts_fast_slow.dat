# Parameters for Potts model with 2-->1->0,
# i.e. 2 decays to 1 fast, then 1 decays to 0 slowly

# Number of spin types q:
3

# List of values of fields of each type: first column is type, second is value
2	0.0
1	0.7
0	1.0

# List of interactions other than Potts type. (Can override Potts ones too.)
# First two columns give the spin types of the interaction; the third column is the new value

2 1		0.1
